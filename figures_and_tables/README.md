- `figure_2.R`: R code to generate Figure 2 from the manuscript. `figure_2.Rdata` contains the environment used to generate this figure, and this file is in turn used in `appendix_tables.R` to generate the tables in Appendix S3. 
- `figure_3_S3.1.R`: R code to generate Figures 3 and S3.1 from the manuscript. `figure_3.Rdata` contains the environment used to generate this figure, and this file is in turn used in `appendix_tables.R` to generate the tables in Appendix S3.  
- `figure_4.R`: R code to generate Figure 4B from the manuscript. 
- `figure_S3.2_S3.3.R`: R code to generate Figures S3.2 and S3.3 in Appendix 3. `figure_S3.2.Rdata` contains the environment used to generate this figure, and this file is in turn used in `appendix_tables.R` to generate the tables in Appendix S3.  
- `figure_S4.1.R`: R code to generate Figure S4.1 in Appendix 4.  
- `figure_S5.1.R`: R code to generate Figure S5.1 in Appendix 5.  
- `figure_S5.2.R`: R code to generate Figure S5.2 in Appendix 5.
